This week, we started to think about the development process for _AskBob_.

I met up with our (very friendly) assigned teaching assistant, Ahmed Shahin, who has given guidance on how to proceed from here.

## Next steps

We will continue researching relevant open-source libraries and tools that we could possibly use in order to commence development as quickly as possible with the aim of having a working prototype by the end of the year. I have created an _AskBob_ GitHub repository to get started on the voice assistant component itself as soon as research on speech-to-text engines, text-to-speech libraries and other tools is sufficient to garner a decent enough understanding to start implementing _AskBob_.

We will also research of both existing solutions that are similar to our project (customisable voice assistants, healthcare voice assistants, etc) to understand existing solutions.
